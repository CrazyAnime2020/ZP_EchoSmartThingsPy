<h3>Setting Up SmartThings</h3></li>
</ol>

<h5>Install the SmartApp</h5>

<p>To get PyDash to talk to your SmartThings devices, you need to create a SmartApp that will serve as an API. Navigate to https://graph.api.smartthings.com and log in to your SmartThings IDE account. Select the <strong>&#8216;My SmartApps&#8217;</strong> tab, and click the <strong>&#8216;+ New SmartApp&#8217;</strong> button to create a new SmartApp.</p>

<p>Fill in the required information. The <strong>&#8216;Name&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;Description&#8217;</strong> are both required fields, but their values are not important.</p>

<p>Make sure to click the <strong>&#8216;Enable OAuth in Smart App&#8217;</strong> button to grant REST API access to the new SmartApp. Note the <strong>&#8216;OAuth Client ID&#8217;</strong> and <strong>&#8216;OAuth Client Secret&#8217;</strong>. Both will later be required by the Alexa backend to authenticate with the new SmartApp and talk to SmartThings.</p>

<p>Hit the <strong>&#8216;Create&#8217;</strong> button to get to the code editor. Replace the content of the code editor with the content of the file at: <code>alexa_access.groovy</code></p>

<p>Click the <strong>&#8216;Save&#8217;</strong> button and then <strong>&#8216;Publish -&gt; For Me&#8217;</strong>.</p>

<h2>First Run</h2>

<p>At this time you will have to go to your Echo and say &#8216;Alexa, Talk to Smart Things&#8217; (Replace Smart Things with what the Invocation Name you set). It should say that you are an unautherized Nest user and to check the card in your Echo App. Open the Echo app and look at the card there. It should give you what your UserID is.. &#8216;amzn1.account.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&#8217; ( This may be easier to get from your computer by going to https://echo.amazon.com)</p>

<p>Go to https://alexa.zpriddy.com/alexa/auth/&lt;UserID&gt;/&lt;SmartThings OAuth ClientID&gt;/&lt;SmartThings OAuth ClientSecret&gt;</p>

<p>This should allow you to authorize it to control SmartThings. Login to your SmartThings account and Authorize it.. It should bring you back to the root Alexa page. </p>

<h3>Improved Sample Utterances</h3>

<p>At this time the App will be able to generate a custom list of sample utterances to give you better support in controling your devices. </p>

<p>To get this list go to: https://alexa.zpriddy.com/alexa/samples/&lt;UserID&gt;</p>

<p>Copy the text that is displayed and go back into your Amazon Developer Account. </p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Apps &amp; Services at the top of the page</li>
<li>Click on Alexa</li>
<li>Click on Edit for your SmartThings Skill</li>
<li>Got to Interaction Model</li>
<li>Replace the text in Sample Utterances with the text you the copied.</li>
<li>Click Save</li>
</ol>
